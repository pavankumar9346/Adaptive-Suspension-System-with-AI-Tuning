# Adaptive-Suspension-System-with-AI-Tuning
This system automatically adjusts the vehicle’s suspension stiffness (damping) in real time based on:  Road roughness,  Vehicle speed,  And ride comfort feedback.  It’s a smart suspension system — instead of fixed shock absorbers, it uses sensors and an algorithm to continuously tune how soft or stiff the suspension feels.
